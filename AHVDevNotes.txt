Question: when viewing the records on the Payment to be Posted from HEQ, do you see only Health Equity accounts or additional accounts?

Only one point in the process of working thru the HEQ billing is there a reference to the BenCalc records - in final states of making sure when in all other billing processes the BenCalc table is referenced so that code changes can be made in all needed places

Check for dupes in clients by last name and ssn

What about Billing Indicator??

Lori,

The People listed as having amounts that will result in an over-contribution are there because they have no Tax Filing Status (Single or Joint).

The routine that I wrote that tries to calculate the maximum allowable amount cannot determine which formula to use because the Tax Filing Status was missing, the value returned for the maximum allowable contribution amount for the year was zero.

Please check and add a Tax Filing Status for:

Nicholas Blemaster
Jordan Crist
Jason Lacy
Richard Mihcaelson
Shawn Sprenger


Please let me know if anyting else comes up.

Lori,

The H:\FTP\HealthEquity\out folder contains two sets of EEF-AHV files.  The revisions in place now use the preferred method of handling null values so that a string of empty fields look like this: |||||| instead of this: |""|""|""|""|""|""|.

I also double-checked the code that assigned the proper 1 or 2 for individual vs. Employer group, as well as the wording that appears on the prompt when moving a person from an invidividual to a Employer Group.

Two more tests are pending: I'm checking the code that will terminate Luke Skywalker's employment and I'm creating a fictitious company that will contain a couple of fictional people so that the test for when a company begins using the Employee portal is handled properly.  I hope to finish those final steps later today.

Mike

Employer_Class

Q_sendall 02 all appends AA_HQY_NEWACCOUNTtemp records into AA_HQY_NEWACCOUNT and the Plan Number field becomes the Employer_Class field
PlanNumber ---> Employer_Class


Q_sendall 04 updates the AA_HQY_NEWACCOUNT.[Employer Name] and [Employer City] and other Employer fields to the value stored in the Employers table based a match of the AA_HQY_NEWACCOUNT.Employer_Class field (which will then later change to a 1 or 2) and the Employers.CompanyID field
!!!*** but only if the HQY_Class equals 2.  This means that the only client records that are populated with Employer data are when the Employers have an HQY_Class of 2 - meaning that they are an employer that has elected to use the employer web portal


Q_sendall 05 then updates the AA_HQY_NEWACCOUNT.Employer_Class field to 2 if the [Employer Name] and [Employer City] fields are Not Null
Q_sendall 06 updates the AA_HQY_NEWACCOUNT.Employer_Class to 1 if both the [Employer Name] and [Employer City] are either Null or ""

Luke Skywalker has the following dates in his client record:


Birthdate: 8/14/1966
InsurEffective: 11/1/2016
DateAccountOpened: 1/26/2017
HEQEligStatStartDate: 2017-06-28    was generated when we moved him from Individual to Employed by Women's COA on 6/28 (today's test)





Q_sendall 02 pulls both DateAccountOpened and InsuranceEffective dates.
  Insurance Effective is set to HEQEligStatStartDate if it exists, or InsuranceEffective if it does not exist.


Q_sendall 02 all then applies the InsurEffective value to the Coverage Start Date


When creating an Individual History record...   the routine was using either the HEQEligStatStartDate (if it existed, or the Date Account Opened instead of the InsurEffective date.  This correction has been applied.
